## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL (210, 70%, 50%) which converts to a vibrant blue (#3399FF), evoking trust and clarity.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue, HSL (210, 20%, 95%) which converts to (#F0F8FF), provides a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL (180, 60%, 40%) which converts to a contrasting teal (#33A3A3), used sparingly for highlights and call-to-action elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' for both headings and body text. 'Inter' is a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Minimalist, vector-based icons that are easy to understand. Icons should primarily use the primary color with the accent color for highlights.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on usability. The chat interface should be the main focus, with easy access to voice and video call functions.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide a smooth and responsive user experience. Use animations sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.
